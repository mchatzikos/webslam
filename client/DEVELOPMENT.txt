Development Setup for Working with Hubzero

1. Download and install Oracle Virtual Box:
   https://www.virtualbox.org/


2. Download version 1.3.1 of Hubzero:
version 1.3.1:
	https://hubzero.org/hubzero-open-source-release-131
version 2.0.0:
	https://hubzero.org/download


3. Create a new HubZero Virtual Machine (VM)

Follow these directions on Stack Overflow for importing a VMWare vm into VirtualBox:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1505021/virtualbox-and-vmdk-vmx-files 

â€œVMDK/VMX are VMWare file formats but you can use it with VirtualBox, just create
a new Virtual Machine and when it asks for a hard disk choose "Use an existing
hard disk" and click on the "button with folder and green arrow image on the combo
box right" which opens Virtual Media Manager, it looks like this
(http://www.virtualbox.org/attachment/wiki/Screenshots/virtual-disk-image-manager.png)
(you can open it directly pressing CTRL+D on main window or in
File > Virtual Media Manager menu)...

And then you can add the VMDK/VMX hard disk image and setup it for your virtual machine"


4. Setup Networking for the new HubZero VM

The main goal of the network settings for the hubzero vm is to keep the vm off
of a publicly accessible network because the root login and the admin login for
the hubzero web application are well known and can be quickly hacked by intruders.

Using a "host only" network setting allows us to have a static IP address to access
the vm without using port forwarding.  However, "host only" networks do not allow
access to the outside internet and a "host only" network needs to be paired with a
NAT network.

An explanation on how to enable both host only and NAT network adapters can be put
together from the following two resources:

5. Point the VM storage to the hubzero VM

By this point, you have set up a new VM, but it is not yet a Hubzero VM.
To do that, you must link the new machine to the HZ VMDK file, by
adjusting "Settings > Storage > Controller SATA > hubzerovm-2.0.0.vmdk"
where the last file may be found in your local install of HZ; for instance,
on my machine, it is in
	hubzerovm-2.0.0/hubzerovm-2.0.0
where the top directory is the one extracted from the archive.


6. Validate HubZero VM

If not already started, startup up the new VM.

Login via the VirtualBox console screen.
example login: root
Password: <see the hubzero website>


7. Get VM IP Address

We need to get the virtual machine ip address so we can access the virtual machine
from the browser and other tools as needed.

In the VirtualBox console screen run the following command:
# ifconfig > ifconfig_output
# less ifconfig_output

The ip address needed should be either the eth0 or eth1 ip address.

In our example case the ip address is:
192.168.56.101

Open a browser and see if HubZero responds to http requests:
http://192.168.56.101/


8. Deploy the WebSLAM Client into HubZero

If not already started, startup up the new VM.

  A. Manual Deploy
  
Login to the new VM and create the following directory:
	/var/www/example/components/com_webslam		(version 1.3.1)
or:	/var/www/example/app/components/com_webslam	(version 2.0.0)

Download the git private repository into the newly created directory:
git clone https://github.com/NCAR/webslam-client.git
(You will be asked for your github login and password.)
     
  B. IDE Deployment (recommended)

These directions are written for IntelliJ, but other IDEs should have similar features.

Find your Deployment Setting.  The placement of this screen is different in all the versions of IntelliJ.

Add a New Deployment (Click the +, plus sign)

Name: hubzero_client_server

Connection
Type: SFTP
SFTP host: 192.168.56.101
Port: 22
Root path: /
User name: root
Password: ***********

Mappings
Local path: /
Development Path on Server '':
/var/www/example/components/com_webslam


Update the Options for Deployment

Most of these are pretty self explainitory, but I like to turn the following options on:
- Delete target items when source ones do not exist
- Create emtpy directories
- Upload changed files automatically to the default server: ALWAYS


9. Start up hubzero at:
http://192.168.56.101
and go to the bottom of the page to click on "Jump to your Hub".

Access the newly deployed WebSLAM client application:
http://192.168.56.101/webslam
